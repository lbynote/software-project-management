# software project management concepts
Application of management activities -- planning, coordinating, measuring, monitoring, controlling, and reporting -- to ensure that the development and maintenance of software is systematic, disciplined, and quantified.

## old plan becomes outdated very soon
Fou have a plan but you continously get distracted by additional "request". A flood of them is a phenomenon called **request creep**.

For some requests, we need to :
- Politely say "NO".
- Tell that I am willing to help if I am not that busy.
- Analyze the impact of the additional requests on my current schedule.
- Ask for more monet or time, or both. (The management board would usully aggree as they have already invested a lot, as long as your counter-requests are reasonable.)

## Other difficulties

- Programmers with various background and various personal goals.
- Programming languages.
- Licenses.
- Development processes.
- Infrastructures.

Solutions:
- Organizational:
    - Get a lot of monet. Get a lot of resources. Get a lot of support from govement and funding bodies.
    - Make sure employees write clear documentation and self-documenting code before they leave the project.
    - Have a requirements management procedure.
    - Incentives. Make sure hard and productibe workers are rewarded and project parasites are rewarded(if not downgraded).
    - Make sure userful developers don't get marginalized due to personal idiosyncrasy.
- Montivational: understanding decelopents' motivations is the best way -- in some sense, the only way -- to manage a project.
    - Establish a shared belief that people can do better together. The goal f management is to make people continue to believe so.
    - Get deep personal satisfaction from doing one's best work, and from appreciating and being appreciated by one's peers.
    - Coercive techeniques don't work. People should feel that their connection to project, and influence over it, is directly proportional to their contributions.
- Set standards for communications.

# proprietary software
proprietary: relating to an owner or ownership.

The software is owned by a company, which sets out many restrictions on use, modification and distribution. We need to pay (explicitly or implicitly) before we can use it.

**Mini assignment**(no submission required): read a proprietary software license and figure out the described.  
The mini assignment asks you to read a license from a proprietary software. e.g., the one from Microsoft's OneNote:[https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Microsoft-software-license-terms-Microsoft-OneNote-419E41C9-1F2B-41AE-91CD-E119043F0887]( https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Microsoft-software-license-terms-Microsoft-OneNote-419E41C9-1F2B-41AE-91CD-E119043F0887)(MIT licenses are not for proprietary software).

# free and open-source software
These software are usually free of charge.  
Many have very high quality.  
You can read, modify or redistribute the source code, if the softawre is free or open source.  
Free and open-source software are quite prevalent today.

## Free software emphasizes idology.
A nobele cause.  
Four Essential Freedoms (run, study, modify, redistribute).  

## Open-source software emphasizes practicability.
More practical.  
Great convenience.  
Community driven development model.  

## The difference
The difference between free and open source is largely on philosophical matters.

*The two terms describe almost the same category of software, but they stand for views based on fundamentally different values. Open source is a development mothodology; free software is a social movement.* -- Richad Stallman

# overhead at the beginning
Opening up a project can add whole new sets of complexities, and cost more in the short term than simply keeping it in-house.  

Extra work (or pure overhead t first) for the people least familiar with the project to get started:
- Arrange the code to be comprehensible to complete strangers.
- Write development documentation.
- Set discussion forums.
- Answeer questions for potential developers.
- Set other collaboration tools.
- Set a project home page.
- Automate compilation, packaging and installtion.

# benefits in the long run.
- Significant organizational benefits -- let the outside world know what you are doing.
- A low-cost form of advertisement.
- Global influence.
- Benefits greatly outweigh the costs.
